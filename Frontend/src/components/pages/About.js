Vatsalya means 'Home of Love', and was founded in 2020 to provide support for women, children and LGBT communities,
 who have been affected by HIV and AIDS, trafficking, sexual violence, and poverty. We operate in Ahmednagar, 
a town and district in the agricultural region of Maharashtra, India, and provide services to over 15,000 beneficiaries annually.

We are more than an NGO, we are a strong and passionate family, united in the belief that no one should stand alone. 
 Many of our staff first came to us as beneficiaries to use our services. 
 We understand that resilience - the desire to survive - is an extraordinary force.  
A sense of belonging and compassion can nurture even the most destitute and fragile people to not just survive, 
but to thrive in life. </p>
<p>We welcome everyone with an open heart and without prejudice. </p>
